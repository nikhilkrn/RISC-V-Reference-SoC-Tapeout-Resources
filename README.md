# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program 

Welcome to my documentation for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** by VSD India & IIT Gandhinagar.  
This repo tracks my weekly / lab-wise progress as I go through the entire ASIC design flow: from RTL → GDSII and tapeout, using open-source tools.

## 📆 Weekly / Lab Structure

| Week / Lab | Topic | Documentation | Status |
|------------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Week 00 / Lab 0 | Setup & Tool Installation (Icarus Verilog, Yosys, GTKWave) | [Lab0 README](week-00/README.md) | ✅ |
|... | ....| .... | ...|

Each week / lab folder will contain:

- `README.md` — objectives, steps, results  
- `img/` — images of results, GUI tools, terminal output

## 🔧 About The Program

- **Duration:** ~20 Weeks  
- **Flow:** RTL → Simulation → Synthesis → Floorplanning → Placement & Routing → Timing Closure → GDSII → Tapeout  
- **Tools:** Open-source EDA tools (Yosys, GTKwave, ngspice, OpenLane, Magic, ngspice, etc.)
- **Goal:** Gain practical, end-to-end experience in chip design and contribute toward advancing semiconductor self-reliance.
